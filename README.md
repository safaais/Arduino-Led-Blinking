# Arduino-Led-Blinking

This project shows how control the brightness of a red LED using an Arduino Uno board.

## Components:
 Arduino Uno Board.
 
 Breadboard.
 
 Red LED.
 
 Resistor.
 
 Wires.


## Code:

```
int ledPin = 13; // Define the pin where the LED is connected

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn the LED on
  delay(1000); // Wait for one second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn the LED off
  delay(1000); // Wait for one second
}
```

## Circuit:

Hereâ€™s a simple LED control system. The Arduino receives instructions from the code, processes them, and then sends signals to the LED through the resistor, controlling its brightness.
